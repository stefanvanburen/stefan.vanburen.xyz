Great read — an exploration of [little "m" minimalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism) that goes to the roots of the modern phenomenon, across disciplines.
The structure of the book lent itself to being a quick read.
There's four sections, each with ~eight chapters of a couple pages.
I finished the book over the course of about two weeks, which (unfortunately) is pretty quick for me to get through a book nowadays.
