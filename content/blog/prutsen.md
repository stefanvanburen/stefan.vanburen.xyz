I recently learned of "prutsen", a Dutch word meaning ["to fiddle around"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prutsen).
In a lot of ways, I think it encompasses a lot of how I approach some of my computer diversions.

For example, this website, at the time of writing, has [135 commits on it](https://github.com/svanburen/blog).
With a total of five published posts, and most of my posts being written within a commit or two, much of the work being done on this site is cosmetic.
For example, [tweaking CSS indentation](https://github.com/svanburen/blog/commit/6107cf3e0cbea2313179880abab3fd3050693a12) or [ensuring the RSS feed contains the entire content of the post](https://github.com/svanburen/blog/commit/12330139fc35f3d5289910bc9367b5abee8b5e12).

Likewise, my dotfiles sit at a [healthy 910 commits](https://github.com/svanburen/dotfiles) currently.
I recently went through a bit of a [dotfile purge](/blog/spring-cleaning) that added quite a few of those, but in general, tweaking my dotfiles has been a hobby for the better part of a decade.

Prutsen gives me a name for all this tweaking and fiddling - so cathartic!

_Update_: After this post I truly could not remember where I had found "prutsen" in the first place.
I finally found it: [Do Inhabit](https://thedobook.co/products/do-inhabit-style-your-space-for-a-creative-and-considered-life), by Sue Fan and Danielle Quigley.

From the book:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "This Dutch word translates loosely to doing something of very little significance that only looks like work, or tinkering."

Good to know where it originally came from!
