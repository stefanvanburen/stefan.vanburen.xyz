I've recently moved from a largely merge commit based git workflow to a squash and merge based one.
Learning to flex my `git rebase` muscles has been refreshing, and I'm enjoying the cleaner `git log` that results.

As part of the workflow, I've changed my `git pull` to https://github.com/svanburen/dotfiles/commit/de0f57867ba3270212c02884ec1053e64158fa1b[default to rebasing on pull], rather than merging (the default).
The only thing that's rough about this workflow is whenever I have local changes, `git pull` will fail, telling me that I have unstaged changes:

[source,bash]
----
{{< highlight bash >}}
â–µ git pull
error: cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes.
error: please commit or stash them.
{{< / highlight >}}
----

To work around this, I'd typically do a compound shell command (I'm using `fish` - you would typically do this with `&&` in `bash`):

[source,bash]
----
{{< highlight bash >}}
â–µ git stash; and git pull; and git stash pop
{{< / highlight >}}
----

I recently discovered the solution to needing this: `git pull --autostash`!
It automatically stashes your current working directory and re-applies it after the pull.

[source,bash]
----
{{< highlight bash >}}
â–µ git pull --autostash
Created autostash: a14af18
Current branch master is up to date.
Applied autostash.
{{< / highlight >}}
----

This option is so handy for my workflow that I https://github.com/svanburen/dotfiles/commit/297733[made an alias for it].
