# Hi, I'm Stefan

I'm a software engineer based in Boston.

The languages I'm most productive / comfortable in at the moment are Python and Go.

I'm currently interested in Clojure, Rust, TypeScript, and Elixir.

I've also previously programmed in C, C++, Java, and others, to varying degrees of enjoyment. ðŸ˜‰
