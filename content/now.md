At [work](https://blues.io), largely flexing my Go and frontend chops.

On the side, I've been toying around with Clojure, trying to wrap my head around functional programming paradigms.

Other than that, hunkering down for the Boston winter, avoiding the virus, and enjoying life with my partner and cats.
