I'm a software engineer based in Boston.

At the moment, the languages I'm most fluent in are Python and Go.

I'm currently interested in Clojure, Rust, TypeScript, and Elixir.

I've also programmed in C, C++, Java, and others, to varying degrees of enjoyment. ðŸ˜‰

Check out my open source work on https://github.com/svanburen[GitHub].

Feel free to shoot me an email - vanburenstefan (at) gmail (dot) com.
